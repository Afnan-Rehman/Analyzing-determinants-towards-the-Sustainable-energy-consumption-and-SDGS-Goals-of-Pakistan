# Analyzing-determinants-towards-the-Sustainable-energy-consumption-and-SDGS-Goals-of-Pakistan

Energy is a very significant determinant in economic progress and one of main 
contributor to improving economic activity. Energy consumption results in the 
increased manufacturing processes which helps a country in expanding economic 
growth. The increase in economic expansion, technological advancement and 
urbanization results in the increase in energy consumption over time (Majeed & Tauqir, 
2020). As a necessity of life, energy has a significant impact on economic growth and 
plays a very vital role in production of goods and services and ensuring populations 
wellbeing within any economy. The economic industrialisation, growing population,
widespread urbanization and the increased consumption of electrical equipment in
day-to-day life due to rising living standards have resulted in the increased electricity 
demand worldwide (NEPRA, 2018). Consequently, in Pakistan, Inefficient energy
demand is increasing while the resources have been exploited over the years. With 
inefficient energy infrastructure, Pakistan is suffering from the issue of climate change
and pollution. The exploitation of energy resources results from inefficient equipment, 
ineffective planning and energy market incompetence and pollution. The renewable 
energy adoption is regarded as one of the cleanest and sustainable way to fight with 
these challenges. The renewable energy minimizes the environmental impact as it 
reduces the carbon emissions into the environment resulting in less pollution. The 
renewable energy adoption also helps diversify the energy portfolio and enhance 
energy security compared to non-renewable energy sources (Al-Mulali et al., 2013). 
The focus of this research is on SDG goal 7 i.e., to build infrastructure to ensure 
that all the underdeveloped countries have access to sustainable and clean energy as 
the energy sustainability and usage have a direct impact on the economic growth and 
environment of any country, SDG 11 i.e., making cities and human settlements 
inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable as providing affordable and energy is 
essential for improving the living conditions in the urban areas, SDG goal 8 i.e., decent 
work and economic growth as the goal aim to provide sustainable economic growth, 
full and productive employment opportunities and decent work conditions for all.
Providing affordable energy not only improves the urban living conditions but also 
helps the country industry to grow resulting in better and more employment 
opportunities for the people and economic growth of the country (UNDP, 2019). Well 
planned urbanization and efficient energy system results in resilient infrastructure and 
fosters industry growth i.e., SDG goal 9, Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive 
and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. 
Energy consumption is one of the most important determinants for economic 
growth of the country and improves the standards of oneâ€™s living (Felipe et al., 2019). 
Unplanned Urban growth and underdeveloped electricity network significantly effects 
the economy of Pakistan, leading to sudden load shedding and frequent power 
outages around the country. These disruptions are result of the growing demand for 
energy, which affects the overall stability and development of the economy. 
Furthermore, the process of urbanization in Europe took 150 years to increase from 
10 % to 15% (Zhang, 2016), while the same transition has occurred in one third time 
in Pakistan. Rapid urbanization strains the existing infrastructure, which can lead to 
inefficiencies in the energy distribution and increased operational cost for the 
industries. The aim of this research is to model the Pakistan need for investment in 
sustainable and renewable energy production resources to achieve SDG goal 7, 
economic growth, better transition to urbanization and carbon emission in the 
environment and to see how these determinants get effected by the increased energy 
consumption. The aim of this research is to model the Pakistan need for investment 
in better energy production resources to achieve SDG goal 7, as the economic growth, 
better transition to urbanization and carbon dioxide emissions and low carbon 
electricity production significantly impacts and leads to increased energy consumption
from renewable sources and leads people having access to sustainable and clean 
energy in Pakistan
